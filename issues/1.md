## Problem

When generating scripts for PANORA Science Narrator domain, the system ignores the custom system prompt configured in Character Bible tab.

**Current Behavior:**
Scripts still generate fictional characters (Dr. An, KAI, The Architect) despite user's custom prompt explicitly prohibiting this.

**Root Cause:**
File `services/llm_story_service.py` function `_schema_prompt()` always uses hardcoded base_rules, never reads custom system prompt from Character Bible settings.

**Required Fix:**
1. Load custom system prompt for domain+topic from configuration
2. Use custom prompt instead of hardcoded rules when available
3. Keep only technical requirements (language + JSON schema)

**Expected After Fix:**
- ✅ NO fictional characters for PANORA domain
- ✅ Second-person narration ("Bạn")  
- ✅ Medical/scientific visuals only
- ✅ Follow custom 5-stage structure

**Priority:** CRITICAL
